							<h1>Jurassic Park</h1>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurassic Park is an American science fiction media franchise centered on a disastrous attempt to create a theme park of cloned dinosaurs. It began in 1990 when Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment bought the rights to the novel by Michael Crichton before it was even published.
							<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							The book was successful, as was Steven Spielberg's 1993 film adaptation, which led to four sequels, although only the first two films were based on the novels. Numerous video games based on the franchise have been created by various software developers since the release of the 1993 film. Since 1996, several water rides based on the series have been opened at various Universal theme parks.
							<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							The Jurassic Park Ultimate Trilogy was released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 25, 2011, in North America. The first film was re-released in 3D on April 5, 2013.
							<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							The fourth film, Jurassic World, was initially scheduled to be released in the summer of 2005, but was delayed numerous times and was ultimately released in June 2015. It became the first film to gross over $500 million worldwide in its opening weekend, and grossed over $1.6 billion through the course of its theatrical run, making it the sixth highest-grossing film of all time. It was also the second highest-grossing film of 2015. When adjusted for monetary inflation, this film is the second highest grossing in the franchise after Jurassic Park. An animated film, Lego Jurassic World: The Indominus Escape, was released in October 2016 with the home media release of Jurassic World, alongside a short film, Employee Safety Video. Two other interactive Lego short films, Lego Jurassic World: Rescue Blue/Escape the Indoraptor, were also released in 2018, followed by an animated special, Lego Jurassic World: The Secret Exhibit, which aired on NBC later that year.
							<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							A fifth film, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, was released in June 2018. The film grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide, making it the third Jurassic film to pass the billion dollar mark. It is the third highest-grossing film of 2018 and the 12th highest-grossing film of all time. A sixth film, tentatively titled Jurassic World 3, is scheduled to be released on June 11, 2021. As of 2000, the franchise had generated $5 billion in revenue, making it one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.
							<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							In 2018, the first film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."</p>

							<h1>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</h1>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a 2018 American science fiction adventure film and the sequel to Jurassic World (2015). Directed by J. A. Bayona, it is the fifth installment of the Jurassic Park film series, as well as the second installment of a planned Jurassic World trilogy. Derek Connolly and Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow both returned as writers, with Trevorrow and the original Jurassic Park director Steven Spielberg as executive producers.
							<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							Set on the fictional Central American island of Isla Nublar, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, it follows Owen Grady and Claire Dearing as they rescue the remaining dinosaurs before a volcanic eruption destroys it. Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, B. D. Wong, and Jeff Goldblum reprise their roles from previous films in the series, with Rafe Spall, Justice Smith, Daniella Pineda, James Cromwell, Toby Jones, Ted Levine, Isabella Sermon, and Geraldine Chaplin joining the cast.
							<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							Filming took place from February to July 2017 in the United Kingdom and in Hawaii. Produced and distributed by Universal Pictures, Fallen Kingdom premiered in Madrid on May 21, 2018, and was released internationally in early June 2018 and in the United States on June 22, 2018. The film grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide, making it the third Jurassic film to pass the billion-dollar mark, and was the third-highest-grossing film of 2018 and the 12th highest-grossing film of all-time. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Pratt and Howard's performances, Bayona's direction, the visuals and the "surprisingly dark moments", while others suggested the series had run its course, criticizing the screenplay and predictability. An untitled sequel is set to be released on June 11, 2021, with Trevorrow returning to direct.</p>

							<h1>Good Dinosaur</h1>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Good Dinosaur is a 2015 American 3D computer-animated drama adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Directed by Peter Sohn in his directorial debut and written by Meg LeFauve from an original idea by Bob Peterson, the film is set in an alternate history in which dinosaurs never became extinct. The film follows a young and timid Apatosaurus named Arlo, who meets an unlikely human friend while traveling through a harsh and mysterious landscape. The film features the voices of Raymond Ochoa, Jack Bright, Sam Elliott, Anna Paquin, A.J. Buckley, Steve Zahn, Jeffrey Wright and Frances McDormand.
							<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							Peterson, who came up with the idea for the story, directed the film until August 2013. In October 2014, Sohn was announced as the new director. The film, alongside Inside Out, marked the first time Pixar released two feature films in the same year.
							<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							The Good Dinosaur premiered on November 10, 2015 in Paris and was released in the United States on November 25, 2015. The film grossed $332 million worldwide against a $175 million budget. This resulted in a total net loss of $85 million, becoming the first Pixar film to be a box office bomb.</p>

							<h1>Walking with Dinosaurs 3D</h1>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking with Dinosaurs is a 2013 family film about dinosaurs set in the Late Cretaceous period, 70 million years ago. The production features computer-animated dinosaurs in live-action settings with actors John Leguizamo, Justin Long, Tiya Sircar, and Skyler Stone providing voice-overs for the main characters. It was directed by Neil Nightingale and Barry Cook from a screenplay by John Collee.
							<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							The film was produced by BBC Earth and Evergreen Films and was titled after BBC's 1999 television documentary miniseries of the same name. The film, with a budget of US$80 million, was one of the largest independent productions to date; it was financed by Reliance Big Entertainment and IM Global instead of a major studio. The majority of distribution rights were eventually sold to 20th Century Fox. The crew filmed footage on location in the U.S. state of Alaska and in New Zealand, which were chosen for their similarities to the dinosaurs' surroundings millions of years ago. Animal Logic designed computer-animated dinosaurs and added them to the live-action backdrop. Though the film was originally going to lack narration or dialogue, 20th Century Fox executives decided to add voiceovers, believing it would connect audiences to the characters.
							<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							Walking with Dinosaurs premiered on 14 December 2013 at the Dubai International Film Festival. It was released in cinemas in 2D and 3D on 20 December 2013. Critics commended the film's visual effects but found its storytelling to be subpar and derided the voiceovers as juvenile. The film grossed US$36.1 million in the United States and Canada and US$90.5 million in other territories for a worldwide total of US$126.5 million. The Hollywood Reporter stated the film's global box office performance was disappointing in context of the production budget and marketing costs.

							<h1>Dinosaur Revolution</h1>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinosaur Revolution is a four-part American nature documentary produced by Creative Differences. It utilizes computer-generated imagery to portray dinosaurs and other animals from the Mesozoic era. The program was originally aired on the Discovery Channel and Science.
							<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							Dinosaur Revolution was released to mixed reviews, with some citing the quality of its animation and a lack of seriousness in its tone as reasons for criticism. It was, however, praised for its educational content and general energy.</p>

							<h1>Clash of the Dinosaurs</h1>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clash of the Dinosaurs is a four-part television mini-series produced by Dangerous LTD for Discovery Channel. The show premiered on December 6, 2009 with the first two episodes scheduled back-to-back.
							<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							Clash of the Dinosaurs was poorly received, with critics citing leaps of logic and repetitive reenactments. The series also became the target of controversy when it emerged that a paleontologist interviewed onscreen had been quote-mined; the dispute was resolved by reediting the offending scene.</p>
